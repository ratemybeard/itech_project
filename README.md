Target Python runtime version: 2.7.5

If you have any version of python other than 2.7.5 running, then complete section 3.2.1 of the Tango with Django by following this link: http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/chapters/requirements.html#installing-the-software. 

You will then need to create an appropriate virtual environment to enable the application to run smoothly. We would suggest following Tango with Django section 3.2.3 to esnure that Pip is installed correctly.

With Pip installed you next need to ensure Django v1.7 is installed. Open a Command Prompt or terminal window, and issue the following command: pip install -U django==1.7 

The remaining installation requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file. Install the rest of these packages by running the appropriate command from the command propmt or terminal window. For example, to install the package "coverage (3.6)" issue the following command: pip install coverage==3.6

With the appropriate packages installed you should then clone our github repository to your local machine.

You can either select "Clone in Desktop" or "Download Zip" from the github menu to the right of the repository home screen, or else issue a similar command from a command prompt or terminal window.

To run the program locally navigate to the project directory using the command prompt or terminal window, and issue the command "python manage.py runserver". With the program running navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/rmb using a web browser to view the web application on your local machine. ALternatively navigate to ratemybeard.pythonanywhere.com/rmb to view the deployed version of our application.
